# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
The **Iris Flower Classification** project is a machine learning task that involves predicting the species of an iris flower based on its physical attributes. The dataset used is the **Iris Dataset**, a widely recognized dataset in the machine learning community.

## Dataset Information
The dataset consists of **150 samples**, each belonging to one of three iris species:
- **Iris Setosa**
- **Iris Versicolor**
- **Iris Virginica**

Each flower is described by four features:
1. **Sepal length (cm)**
2. **Sepal width (cm)**
3. **Petal length (cm)**
4. **Petal width (cm)**

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies iris flowers into their respective species based on the provided features.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset
   - Check for missing values
   - Normalize or standardize the data (if required)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize data distributions
   - Use scatter plots and pair plots to understand feature relationships

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Various classification algorithms will be explored, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Decision Trees
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Random Forest
     - Neural Networks

4. **Model Training & Evaluation:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80% train, 20% test)
   - Train the model on the training data
   - Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Results & Analysis
After training the model, accuracy and other metrics will be evaluated to determine the best-performing algorithm. Visualization of decision boundaries and misclassified examples will also be included in the analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning-based classification models
- Deploy the model as a web application
- Optimize feature selection for improved accuracy
